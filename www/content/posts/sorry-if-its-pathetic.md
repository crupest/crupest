## Not Healable

It's hard for people to admit the illness or pain he/she got can __not__ be healed. Generally speaking, a big part of the deceases that can be recognized by human beings can __not__ be healed completely. Not to mention those we can't name.

Most of us will be taking pains with ourselves along our rest life. I'm sorry if it sounds kind of pessimistic. But this is a truth, indeed.

## Robustness

Just like sometimes our software will run into some bugs, we can also run into some trouble. One thing in software development is called _robustness_, which technically means that a program can continue to work even if it get running into some unexpected conditions. However this error needs to be not fatal like death of human beings.

## No Robustness

I don't think you have to be robust. We all trap into some trouble we can't predict. What's worse is that the trouble is what we can't recover from.

We can't make the world totally not to exist any issue. But we learn from our past. Like there is song named _What doesn't Kills You Makes You Stronger.

We can't write a program that can always avoid crashing. Actually whether a program contains a bug is not decidable, I think, according to Turing's theory of halting problem. We can not even determine whether the given program will halt. We are __never__ able to make a accurate prediction of our future.

## So What Can We Do?

If we don't die, we always have a chance to make the old wrong things right. But the requirement is simple, that is, we don't die. If we still have a computer like if we still have our body alive, we can fix things.

Again, we can't fix all potential errors. But as time flies, the more things we fix, the less unknown problems exist in the universe. That's definite true because the total problem set does not grow. If it did grow, it is actually not. It's just you don't know their existence, which doesn't mean you will never encounter them.

Maybe that is optimistic or sounds happier.
