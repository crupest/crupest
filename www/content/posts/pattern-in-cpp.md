This is a script from Kung Fu Panda, which is one of my favorite film.

People have been struggling for days to find a pattern in which they can code better. Especially those who use Java. They even wrote a book called "Programming Pattern" (or another name since I might forget the name) to show the common patterns.

I don't mean patterns are bad. However there exists many people who strive to the patterns, stick to the patterns or even get stubborn to patterns. Maybe there exists a way to achieve their goals with some not that patterned code but they don't want to use them at all just because the code is not patterned.

I love C++. And the pattern of C++ is exactly *NO PATTERN*. You write code in the way that they do the task most effectively and neatly. You don't need to apply a pattern to achieve your goal. You just write your code naturally with the way you are most comfortable with.

Tools including programming language serve for people but not vice versa. Don't let tools constrain your hands. And when you find tools not convenient, just fix them or make a new one. Just like C++ is evolving all the time. So are all languages.

The best is code is those that express meanings most clearly and achieve goals most effectively and do nothing with patterns.
