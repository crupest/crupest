This is the second article for *past review* series. I had never thought
this would come so fast.

I don't plan to write my past in the order of time. Instead, I will talk
about them in order of significance.

So, what's next thing I want to talk about?

## Begin of Love

You know, what's the most significant thing in recent years. I would say
it was the start of my love. The *love* here literally means love about
sex.

I fell in love with my *first* lover about 2 years ago. He is not my
first lover. My first lover is another person, with whom I kept
relationship for only a few days.

I don't remember the days with the real first lover quite much. I might
have gone out and played with him two times. And in one of my anxious
nights like usual, I couldn't contact him. I felt bad and required more,
which he could never give to me. Now in my brain, there are only some
small pieces of memory about him. I don't remember his name anymore. But
it's the real first love for me so it is engraved in my heart.

On the same night I broke up with my ex-ex-boyfriend and got up with my
ex-boyfriend. He contacts me on an App called little red for the red
logo. It is indeed not the same night. Several nights before that night,
he found me on the App, saying I'm adorable and want to get along with
me. At that time, I haven't let go with ex-ex-boyfriend so I told him,
we could only make good friends and we exchanged our contact
information.

Who would know, I broke with my ex-ex and got in love with ex like a
fluent hand off.

Then I begin a long relationship with my ex-boyfriend.

You might be curious why I talked so much about one with only no more
than two weeks contact. Because it was the first time, I began a real
relationship. It's not about him. It's me to begin to find real person
to begin a real love.

It's from then on that I wanted to really be independent.
