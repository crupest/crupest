    <h1>This is crupest.</h1>
    <p>Welcome To crupest Home!üè†</p>
    <p>I'm very glad to meet you in this page. This is my new home.</p>
    <p>Feel free to contact by email at crupest@outlook.com or, of course I@crupest.life . You can also file an issue in
      any repo on GitHub. Here is the link to my GitHub profile: <a
        href="https://github.com/crupest">https://github.com/crupest</a> .</p>
    <p>Currently this page is hosted on my own server and my own apex domain (crupest.life). You can also share this
      website link, aka, <a href="https://crupest.life">https://crupest.life</a> .</p>
    <p>This is just the home page. I also run some other services on my server and under this domain's subdomain:</p>
    <p>Public:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://blog.crupest.life" target="_blank">https://blog.crupest.life</a>: My blogs in Chinese with <a
          href="https://github.com/halo-dev/halo" target="_blank">halo</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://timeline.crupest.life" target="_blank">https://timeline.crupest.life</a>: My microblogs with
        my
        own web app <a href="https://github.com/crupest/Timeline">Timeline</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Private:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://code.crupest.life" target="_blank">https://code.crupest.life</a>: Browser based vscode with
        <a href="https://github.com/coder/code-server" target="_blank">code-server</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you wish to deploy similar services like mine, you are in the right place. Take a look at <a
        href="https://github.com/crupest/crupest" target="_blank">https://github.com/crupest/crupest</a> and there is
      all you need to start with. The services are built with <a href="https://docs.docker.com"
        target="_blank">docker-compose</a> and some template methodology. There is a convenient python script to help
      you build from start. I don't fully test it because I never migrate my data into other server so it might be kind
      of buggy. However, it always takes some time to make it your own sites. But don't worry and feel free to contact
      me if you run into any issue and I would be glad to help you out.</p>
