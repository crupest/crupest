This directory contains some of my works that I have created. I moved them from individual repositories to here for easier management. Some works are stopped for its temporary purpose. Here are some of the descriptions of them.

- `life`: Something I created in university time. Some for lecture tasks, some are small toys to solve some interesting problems. Maybe more will be added in future.

- `solutions`: Answers to leetcode and acwing algorithms questions. Stopped now for a well-known reason. Maybe more will be added in future, too.

- `teapot`: Answer to the pre-interview test for my first job. Dropped now definitely.

- `ProxyChanger`: Written a long time ago to solve the proxy switching problem in Firefox for a also well-known problem.
