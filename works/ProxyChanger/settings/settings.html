      If this proxy does not work, go to settings page and allow it to access
      private windows. That is a must for setting proxy for extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input your custom manual proxy server. Feel free to make a XSS attack. If
      you succeed to do that, report a bug to me, or maybe mozilla!
    </p>
    <p>
      After input, re-click the button in popup in toolbar to activate it! I bet
      you don't change this frequently so it's not a pain.
