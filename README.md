## Hi! This is **crupest**!

Nice to meet you! 😊

🔭 I have two major projects:

- [Timeline](https://github.com/crupest/Timeline) , a web app.
- [CruUI](https://github.com/crupest/CruUI) , a C++ direct ui library.

Both are in embryonic form. But I'll keep develop them with my ❤. Working on which depends on my mood in that period. Feel free to comment in the repo via issues.

🌱 I’m currently majoring in Computer Science at WHPU.

📚 I'm currently reading *Introduction To Algorithms* though very slowly.

💡 I love programing and every creative technologies and ideas.

🎈 I also have a [blog](https://crupest.life) which includes some emotional essays (in Chinese) written by me. 

💬 Contact me via my email, *crupest@outlook.com* , or open an issue in any of my repos.
