# Hi! This is **crupest**!

Nice to meet you! 😊

🏗️ I'm currently working on [cru](https://github.com/crupest/cru), a C++ direct ui library. It is in embryonic form. But I'll keep develop it with my ❤️. Feel free to comment in the repo via issues.

🌱 I’m currently majoring in Computer Science And Technology at WHPU.

📚 I'm currently reading ~~*Introduction To Algorithms*~~ ~~(temporarily gave up) *Compilers - Principles, Techniques, and Tools*~~ **a lot of books** though very slowly.

💡 I love programing and every creative technologies and ideas.

🎈 I also have [a personal website](https://crupest.life) where you can get more information of me.

💬 Contact me via my email, *crupest@outlook.com* , or open an issue in any of my repos.
